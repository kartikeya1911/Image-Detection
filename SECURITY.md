## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Falcon Detection seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please Do NOT:
- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### Please DO:
1. **Email us** at [your.security.email@example.com] with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

2. **Allow time** for us to investigate and address the issue (typically 7-14 days)

3. **Coordinate disclosure** - We'll work with you on the timing of public disclosure

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

When using Falcon Detection, please follow these security guidelines:

### Backend Security
- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Enable HTTPS** in production
- **Restrict CORS** to specific origins in production
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Use secure authentication** if deploying publicly

### Frontend Security
- **Validate all user inputs** before sending to backend
- **Sanitize file uploads** to prevent malicious files
- **Don't expose sensitive data** in client-side code
- **Use HTTPS** for API calls in production
- **Implement CSP headers** to prevent XSS attacks

### Deployment Security
- **Never deploy with debug mode** enabled
- **Use strong passwords** for all services
- **Keep OS and dependencies updated**
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Use firewalls** to restrict access
- **Regular security audits** of code and infrastructure
- **Backup data regularly**

### Model Security
- **Verify model integrity** before deployment
- **Use trusted model sources** only
- **Monitor for adversarial attacks**
- **Implement input validation** for images

## 🔐 Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Default CORS allows all origins (`allow_origins=["*"]`) - Change this in production!
- No authentication/authorization implemented - Add before public deployment
- File uploads not sanitized - Implement proper validation
- No rate limiting - Add to prevent abuse

### Recommended Improvements
1. Implement JWT-based authentication
2. Add rate limiting middleware
3. Implement file type and size validation
4. Use environment-specific CORS settings
5. Add input sanitization
6. Implement logging and monitoring
7. Add CAPTCHA for public endpoints

## 📋 Security Checklist for Production

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] Changed default CORS settings
- [ ] Added authentication/authorization
- [ ] Implemented rate limiting
- [ ] Added file validation
- [ ] Enabled HTTPS
- [ ] Set secure environment variables
- [ ] Updated all dependencies
- [ ] Configured firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring/logging
- [ ] Created backup strategy
- [ ] Reviewed and tested security
- [ ] Documented security policies

## 🔄 Update Policy
